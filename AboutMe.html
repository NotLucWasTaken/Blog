  <h2> About Me </h2>
 
  <h3> Who am I? </h3>
  <center>
  <p1>
 My name is Luc Boulch, and I am a student in grade 10 at Loyola Highschool. I used to play tennis 5 days a week, playing tournaments for Tennis Quebec on the weekend. Now, I am a youtuber trying to manage my time (and sleep scheudle) while in school. Currently I spend my days doing schoolwokrk, studying the youtube algorithm (what this article is about), or trying to excersise.

    <h3> Things I Enjoy </h3>
    
    <p1> 
      I really enjoy when my hard work gets appreciated. My whole life I have been working hard in anything I put my mind to, whether it be school, sports, or youtube. I also enjoy music, a lot. I'm even listening to music right now. Probably the best feeling in the world right now is getting a 1/10 on youtube, which means that the video you just posted did the best in that time frame out of your past 10 videos, a sign the video will do very good.
      
      <h3> Things I Very Much DONT Enjoy </h3>
  I don't enjoy relying on other people, as it feels like I am completely out of control. Just until recently I had been making all my own thumbnails on youtube and editing all my own videos, doing everything myself. It was only once I got burned out and didn't post for a month that I realized I needed people to help me. Just recently I got a few editors and thumbnail designers. I beleive that this is an important skill to learn in life, and I am happy to be learning it.
