       <h3> What Is This? </h3>
    
       <p> 
     In this article I share virtually all the knowledge I have about a topic that I am very passionate about; the youtube algorithm. I have been studying the algorithm for over a year now, and I have been posting videos for a bit longer than that. In this time, I beleive I have gathered a pretty decent understanding of everything that you need to get a so called "viral" video. Often times, people wonder why their videos aren't gaining much traction, and pretty much every single time you can look to the video metrics to see why. This article covers the two main metrics, Watch Time and Click Through Rate. These are basically the only two things you need to be familiar with to have a viral type video. Once I started understanding these metrics, and how to increase them, I started racking up views. In this article I simply pass my knowledge on to you.

    Watch time is simple and complex at the same time. It is simple because it is self explanatory: it is how long someone watches your video for. Getting a watch time over 50% (or half of the video) is essential to have a viral video. To learn more about watch time, click whatever you want to see on the navigation bar.

   <h5> <a1 href="CTR.html">Click Through Rate</a1></h5>
  
  <p1>
    Click Through Rate (or CTR) is currently the most important metric to pay attention to on videos. It will make or break the video. Essentially, click through rate is how much a viewer clicks on your video when reccommended. A click through rate of over 10-15% is essential to have a viral video. If you would like to learn more about youtube's click through rate, click whatever you would like to see on the navigation bar.
